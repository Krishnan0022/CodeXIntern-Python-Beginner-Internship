# Python Project Overview

This repository contains three Python projects, each utilizing different libraries for various tasks. Below is an overview of each project.

## 1. **Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib**

This project demonstrates how to use the Pandas library to load a CSV file and perform basic data analysis tasks, such as calculating the average of a selected column. It also utilizes Matplotlib to create visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to analyze and present the data.

### Key Features:
- Load and analyze CSV data with Pandas.
- Calculate basic statistics like averages.
- Visualize data with bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## 2. **Automated Google Search Results Scraper**

This project builds a tool that automates Google searches and extracts the top search results, including titles, links, and short descriptions. It uses Selenium or BeautifulSoup to perform web scraping, which can be helpful for research or SEO analysis.

### Key Features:
- Automates Google search queries.
- Scrapes titles, links, and descriptions of top results.
- Useful for SEO research or data collection.

## 3. **Matrix Operations Tool with NumPy**

In this project, a Python tool is created using NumPy to perform common matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, transposition, and determinant calculation. The application allows users to input matrices interactively and provides the results in a structured format.

### Key Features:
- Perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Calculate matrix transpose and determinant.
- Interactive interface for matrix input.

## Setup Instructions
